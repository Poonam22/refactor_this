== ask yourself:

- are your views handling more than they should?
this is test
- are you sending too many queries to db?
this is 2nd test
- are you DRY?
- are your controller actions doing too much?
- are your actions/methods doing unnecessary work?
- are you hitting the database (insert, update, etc.) when you don't need to?
- are you duplicating view code?
- can you think of a way to DRY your todo model?
  it seems that we're repeating ourselves in all of the status related methods.
- do you have the right schema and db structure?
